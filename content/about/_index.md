This site collects all open source content created for the Data Challenge Lab (DCL). The DCL is an intensive, skills-based class in which students of all academic backgrounds master foundational data science skills. Although the class is only offered at Stanford, much of our content is open source and available to anyone interested in effectively
working with data.

The DCL functions as a testing ground for educational materials, and so our content
is not intended to be static. Using the routine feedback our students provide on all aspects of the course, we constantly improve our content. 

The source for all our materials is on GitHub, and we welcome suggestions for improvement.
