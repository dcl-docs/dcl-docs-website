### Open source content

This site collects all open source content created for the Data Challenge Lab (DCL).

The DCL is an intensive, skills-based class in which students of all academic 
backgrounds master foundational data science skills. Although the class is only

with the intent of helping all people learn to effectively work with data.

### Tested, data-driven curricula

Each quarter, we update and improve the content for the DCL based on feedback
from our students. You can see the most recent version of our curriculum [here](https://dcl-2019-04.github.io/curriculum/).
