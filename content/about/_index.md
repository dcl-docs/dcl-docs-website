This site contains content created for the Stanford Data Challenge Lab (DCL). The DCL is an intensive, skills-based class in which students of all academic backgrounds master foundational data science skills. We offer this content to others with an interest in teaching or learning how to effectively work with data.

The DCL functions as a testing ground for educational materials, and so our content is not intended to be static. Using the routine feedback our students provide on all aspects of the course, we constantly improve our content. 

The source for all our materials is on GitHub, and we welcome suggestions for improvement.  All work referenced here is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
